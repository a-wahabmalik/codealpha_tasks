# CodeAlpha Task 1 - Network Packet Sniffer 
 
## Description 
A lightweight Python-based network traffic sniffer built using scapy to capture, inspect, and analyze packets in real time.
This project helps beginners understand how data flows through a network and how different protocols operate at the packet level.
## Features

📡 Real-time packet capturing from the network interface

🔍 Deep packet inspection (source/destination IP, protocol, payload)

🧩 Protocol identification (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)

📦 Readable packet output for learning and debugging

💡 Perfect for cybersecurity, networking, and packet analysis practice

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Scapy (or socket library)

OS network interface

##  What I Learned

How raw network packets are captured

Understanding packet structure (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP, payload)

Basics of traffic analysis and protocol behavior

How sniffers work behind network tools like Wireshark
