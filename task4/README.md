# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## Overview
Implementation of a Network Intrusion Detection System using Snort/Suricata for real-time network monitoring and threat detection.

## Features & Configuration
- *Rule Configuration*: Custom rules to detect suspicious network activity
- *Traffic Monitoring*: Continuous network traffic analysis for potential threats
- *Alert System*: Real-time notifications for detected intrusions
- *Validation*: System configuration and rule validation testing
- *Attack Visualization*: Dashboard setup for monitoring detected attacks

## Technical Implementation
- NIDS setup with Snort/Suricata
- Custom rule creation for specific threat detection
- Network scanning detection and monitoring
- Configuration validation and testing
